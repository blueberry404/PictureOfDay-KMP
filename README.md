This is a simple project based on KMP-Compose Multiplatform by Jetbrains. It displays recent 5 days Astronomy related posts using the [NASA API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api). Post can contain either image or video.  

Also, I have used loader from [MszProgressIndicator](https://github.com/EhsanMsz/MszProgressIndicator/).

This project is based on the template provided by Abdul Basit and can be accessed here:
https://github.com/SEAbdulbasit/KMP-Compose-Template

You can run this successfully on Android, iOS and Desktop.

Setup for Mac OS and Web is pending. Will work on it if I get time.
